# Workflow

The objectives of this study are to assess the distribution, diversity, abundance, and phylogenetic distribution of 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-Carboxylate Deaminase (ACC-deamianse) in the envrionment. 

This workflow was performed with QIIME, MUSCLE, and raxML on a Liunux-based machine.

## Getting data

Sequences were aggregated from JGI's IMG M server (https://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/m/main.cgi) which aggregates data sequenced at JGI as well as from NCBI.

Seqeunces were gathered by using the gene search function, searching for "1-Aminocyclopropane-1-Carboxylate Deaminase" and pulling 50 studies worth of data at a time. Metadata for each sequence pulled was also gathered.

In addition, using the KEGG pathways option, I gathered abundance of ACC-deaminase in metagenomes as well as the single copy gene rplB to normalize ACC-deaminase abundance accross the studies. 

This leaves us with 4 files:

        1) full_nulc.fasta- ~150K ACC sequences
        2) ACC_rplB_comb.txt- file with the abundance of ACC and rplB in metagenomes.
        3) collated_metadata.txt- the metadata for all 150K sequences
        4) collapsed_metadata.txt- the metadata for the studies data was pulled from, will use as a QIIME mapping file

## Scripts

First thing we need to do is purge the dataset of non-ACC deaminase sequences. Sequences commonly
